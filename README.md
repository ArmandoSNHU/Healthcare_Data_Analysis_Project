# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the role of an **Information Analyst** by exploring hospital patient data to uncover operational insights. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and reporting of key healthcare performance indicators. The dataset is **synthetic** (randomly generated for this project) and does not represent real patient records.

## 🔎 Key Questions Explored
- Which departments have the **highest admission volumes**?  
- What is the **average cost per patient** per department?  
- What are the **readmission rates** overall and by department?  
- Is there a correlation between **length of stay** and **cost**?  
- How do **admissions trend over time**?  

---

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Emergency admissions spike in certain months, suggesting a need for **seasonal staffing adjustments**.  
- Cardiology patients have the **highest average treatment cost**, with a higher-than-average readmission rate.  
- Length of stay has a positive correlation with cost (longer stays = higher expenses).

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3** (pandas, matplotlib)  
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for dashboarding)  
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control & collaboration)
